# overview

Algorithms and data structures from:

* [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms)
* [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit)

including implementations of:

* __search__: binary, breadth-first, Dijkstra
* __sort__: quick, selection

because:

* curiosity
* [tech industry hiring practices are folkloric and irrational](https://www.zachvalenta.com/blog/hiring-in-tech.html)

# run locally

* install dependencies - `poetry install`
* Git hooks - `make hooks`
* everything else - `make help`
